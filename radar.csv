Yarp,assess,techniques,true,"In a world of front applications and many backend micros-service, a reverse proxy could help to have a single endpoint for many different endpoints, aka servers. Yarp is a fast, lightweight, extendable <i>.Net</i> based Reverse proxy. Yarp uses the ASP.NET pipeline technology to managing incoming requests and routes the request streams to its destination. Routing could be done on configuration of on you own written logic. Because the reverse proxy application is just a piece of .Net code, its familiar and easy to work with. Namely, to code, to have it in source control and in your CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure."
Progressive Web App,adopt,techniques,true,"<b>Progressive Web Apps</b> are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. By utilizing service workers that allow intercepting and control of how a web browser handles its network requests and asset caching, the user has reliable fast web pages and offline experience. One of our projects that uses a PWA is <a href=""https://www.terraindex.com"">TerraIndex</a> that allows its field workers that have to cope with unstable mobile connection and still have a reliable web app experience. You can get also started with a beginners tutorial <a href=""https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/"">here</a>"

Vue3,trial,languages & frameworks,true,"When it comes to frontend frameworks, <b>Vue</b> is the newest kid on the block. Now with <a href=""https://v3.vuejs.org/"">version 3 out of beta</a>, XPRTZ's believe it became mature enough to give it a trial run and compare against the more popular Angular and React."
Blazor,trial,languages & frameworks,true,Why mess with javascript if we can run frontend applications with C#
CosmosDb,adopt,platforms,true,Quite interesting because it allows querying within a no-sql database
Fluent Assertions,adopt,tools,true,"<b>Fluent Assertions</b> is an extensive set of extension methods that allow you to more naturally specify the expected outcome of a TDD or BDD-style unit tests. Many of our XPRTZ colleagues have <a href=""https://fluentassertions.com/"">FluentAssertions</a> in their standard set of tools that are used for each project."
Terraform,trial,tools,true,"<a href=""https://www.terraform.io/"">Terraform</a> is an infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool for provisioning and maintaining cloud services.<br><br>Infrastructure-as-code allows us to create and maintain the server configurations that we need to host our applications in an unambigous and repeatable way. This increases the quality of our code because it eliminate any chance of differences between our development, test, acceptance and production environments.<br><br>One of the features of Terraform that we particularly like is it's declarative syntax. This enables us to simply declare what the environment we want Terraform to create should look like, without needing to specify every single step that needs to be executed to create it. This also means that we can see exactly what is configured on each environment without having to parse dozens of install scripts."
AKS,trial,platforms,true,"<a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/nl-nl/services/kubernetes-service/"">Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</a> is a cloud service for hosting and maintaining container applications on Microsoft Azure, using Kubernetes.<br><br>Kubernetes has quickly become the de-facto standard for orchestrating container applications. With AKS we have an easy to use tool for working with Kubernetes in the Azure cloud. Since we have a lot of experience and affinity with Microsoft Azure as .Net developers, AKS is the logical tool we reach for when building container applications."
FakeItEasy,adopt,tools,true,"To test the functionality of a unit, it should be isolated from the rest of the system. With FakeItEasy the units external dependencies are replaced with Mockes, Stubs or Fakes. In FakeItEasy all are created the same, but usage determines what they are. The framework allows an easy setup of an external dependency, and also a verification external dependency. The unit may call Mocking framework with an intuitive and fluent syntax."
Cypress,assess,tools,true,"<b>Cypress</b> is the next generation E2E testing tool that made itself famous by building its own architecture instead of using Selenium like most testing frameworks do. It's an <a href=""https://www.cypress.io/how-it-works/"">all-in-one test suite</a> that is blazing fast, easy to setup and an delight to delop with, that's what we like at XPRTZ so more than enough reason to asses it."
OpenShift,assess,platforms,true,Tool voor het hosten en beheren van container applicaties. Alternatief voor AKS.
AutoFixture,adopt,tools,true,"When writing test code, you want to write code for that case, and not plumming code to initialize test objects because their require it. With AutoFixture you can easyily create testfixures, in the setup code you specify only the test relvante parts. The non-relevant parts are automaticly filled with dummy data during execution. The test case is focused on the essentials of the testcase its self instead of object initialized. It makes Test-Driven Development a step easier and our lives as developers happier."
