  description: '<b>Progressive Web Apps</b> are web apps that use emerging web browser APIs and features along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy 
  to bring a native app-like user experience to cross-platform web applications. By utilizing service workers that allow intercepting 
  and control of how a web browser handles its network requests and asset caching, the user has reliable fast web pages and offline experience.
  One of our projects that uses a PWA is <a href="https://www.terraindex.com">TerraIndex</a> that allows its field workers that have to cope 
  with unstable mobile connection and still have a reliable web app experience.

  blazing fast, easy to setup and an delight to delop with, that''s what we like at XPRTZ so more than enough reason to asses it.'
